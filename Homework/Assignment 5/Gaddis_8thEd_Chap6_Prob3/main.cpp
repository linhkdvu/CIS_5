  Purpose:  Winning Division
            Write a program that determines which of a company’s four divisions 
            (Northeast, Southeast, Northwest, and Southwest) had the greatest 
            sales for a quarter. It should include the following two functions, 
            which are called by main.
            • double getSales() is passed the name of a division. It asks the 
            user for a division’s quarterly sales figure, validates the input, 
            then returns it. It should be called once for each division.
            • void findHighest() is passed the four sales totals. It determines 
            which is the largest and prints the name of the high grossing 
            division, along with its sales figure.
            Input Validation: Do not accept dollar amounts less than $0.00.
