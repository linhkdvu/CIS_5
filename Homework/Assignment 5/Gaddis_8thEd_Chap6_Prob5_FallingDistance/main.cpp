  Purpose:  Falling Distance
            When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula 
            can be used to determine the distance the object falls in a specific
            time period:
            d=1/2gt^2
            The variables in the formula are as follows: d is the distance in 
            meters, g is 9.8, and t is the amount of time, in seconds, that the 
            object has been falling.
            Write a function named fallingDistance that accepts an objectâ€™s 
            falling time (in seconds) as an argument. The function should return
            the distance, in meters, that the object has fallen during that time
            interval. Write a program that demonstrates the function by calling 
            it in a loop that passes the values 1 through 10 as arguments and
            displays the return value.
